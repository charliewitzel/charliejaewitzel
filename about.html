            <p>My name is Charlie Jae Witzel and I live in St. Louis, MO. I am 34 years old and I'm transmasucline/non-binary. I work for Amazon and have been there for 7 years, but looking to find a career in software development.
                In my spare time I love being creative. I handpaint unique punk patches, which I sell in my Etsy Shop. I also perform as a drag king where I love to do spooky numbers and incorperate sfx(special effects) into my looks. I also really enjoy video games, musicals, horror movies, and concerts.

            <h3>Photographer</h3>
            <p>I'm a amateur photographer who has discovered a true passion in capturing the world of drag shows. From the moment I witnessed the artistry, boldness, and individuality displayed by drag performers, I knew I had found my calling.

But my love for photography doesn't stop thereâ€”I also excel at taking headshots, performer photos, and engagement shoots. Collaborating closely with my subjects, I aim to capture their authentic selves, whether it's the confidence of a budding artist or the vulnerability of a seasoned performer. I embrace the diversity and uniqueness of every individual I photograph, creating a safe and accepting space for all. Through my work, I hope to inspire others to embrace their true selves and celebrate the beauty in their differences.</p>
